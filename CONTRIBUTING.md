### 2. Code

### 3. Approach

Write your approach to the problem with proper explanation

```c
// Approach:
// After looking at the question, I thought of using a 2D array to store the characters in the zigzag pattern. But, I realized that it would be a waste of space. So, I thought of using a vector of strings to store the characters in the zigzag pattern. I used a boolean variable goingDown to keep track of the direction of the zigzag pattern. If goingDown is true, then I increment the row number. If goingDown is false, then I decrement the row number. I used a for loop to iterate through the string s. I used a if-else statement to check if the row number is 0 or numRows - 1. If it is, then I change the value of goingDown. I used a for loop to iterate through the vector of strings and append the characters to the string ans. I returned the string ans.
```

### 4. Complexity Analysis

Write your time and space complexity

```c
// Time complexity: O(n^2)
// Space complexity: O(1)
```
